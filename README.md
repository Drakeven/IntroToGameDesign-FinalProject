## The Game

From our ideation process and brainstorming sessions, we decided that to make a game themed about a mad scientist who has had a teleportation experiment go wrong, creating clones of themself. This experiment creates multiple versions of himself, and they must compete to be the last scientist, making them the ‘true scientist’. But because of the experiment, the scientists are all swapping places, and must use this disadvantage to outplay their opponents.

We decided to make a competitive game where players would have to try and outplay their opponents, so we made the objective of the game to be the *'King of the Hill'* and try keep your opponents out of a zone while trying to gain points for yourself. Each player is able to push the other around, but cannot directly attack them.

Our game is focused and designed around several different challenges – pushing other players around, using different level mechanics to outsmart the other player, trying to out-think each other as they swap, and other such counter-play between players.

## The Task

Our task for this assessment was to *"design and build a digital game in your assigned groups using the design methodologies discussed within the subject*, and we were given the following requirements:

* Use the Unity Engine
* Use any asset we want, except for assets that assist in game design, such as prcedural level design systems or complete projects  / tutorial  projects
* Each student would create one level, and there should be an extra tutorial level at the start of the game. Each level should introduce a new feature or mechanic
* The game should be able to be finished / fully experienced within 20 minutes
